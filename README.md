## Platform Support

This library can be used in **NodeJS**.

# Building The Code

To build the code, follow these steps.

1. Ensure that [NodeJS](http://nodejs.org/) is installed. This provides the platform on which the build tooling runs.
2. From the project folder, execute the following command:

  ```shell
  npm install
  ```
3. Ensure that [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) is installed. If you need to install it, use the following command:

  ```shell
  npm install -g gulp
  ```
4. To build and test the code, you can now run:

  ```shell
  npm test
  ```
5. You will find the compiled code in the `dist` folder in CommonJS module format.
